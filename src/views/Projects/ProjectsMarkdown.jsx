## Overview
This project is a music quiz that allows users to select a premade playlist or use their own
Spotify playlist to play. You have to try to guess the song title and its artist to score
points.

There are several modes classified by difficulty and music genre. Some are often updated as they
are linked to a Spotify Playlist, such as the Top 50 - Global mode.

After starting the game, a random song in the playlist will play and you'll have to guess the
artist, the name, or both; each one scoring a point. At the end of the game you can check your
final score and percentage of correct guesses.

## Technologies

Frameworks used:
* create-react-app
* Express.js

Express is used to fetch all the playlists from the Firebase Database, then using the Spotify
API, we fetch the songs to play.

## Overview

*Discord* is a popular communication platform used by gamers all over the world. 
Discord provides a *rich presence* feature that allows users to show off what 
game they are playing and what they are currently doing within the game. 
However, we can use the Discord API to create a custom *rich presence*.

This is a *versatile and customizable* project that allows you to set a *custom status* for your Discord profile. You can setup how to update the status, for instance, you can change how fast the elapsed time changes, set an offset for it, use random texts...

Here is an example:
